     * ordered if all of the input streams are ordered, and parallel if at least
     * one of the input streams are parallel. When a terminating operation is
     * called, all the streams are automatically and explicitly closed, whereby
     * their close handlers are invoked. AutoClosing is performed in sequential
     * order too. If a Stream throws an Exception, it is still guaranteed that

     * will start. Parallelism is only supported within the individual streams
     * provided.
     * <p>
     * N.B. a stream's close method may be called even through that stream never
     * produced any output, if a preceding stream threw an Exception.
