/**
 * The Generated annotation is used to mark source code that has been generated.
 * It can also be used to differentiate user written code from generated code in
 * a single file. When used, the value element must have the name of the code
 * generator. The recommended convention is to use the fully qualified name of
 * the code generator in the value field .
 * <p>
 * For example: com.company.package.classname. The date element is used to
 * indicate the date the source was generated. The date element must follow the
 * ISO 8601 standard. For example the date element would have the following
 * value 2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-0700 which represents 2001-07-04 12:08:56 local
 * time in the U.S. Pacific Time time zone.</p>
 * <p>
 * The comment element is a place holder for any comments that the code
 * generator may want to include in the generated code.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated This annotation class has been replaced by
 * com.speedment.common.annotation.GeneratedCode. Please re-generate your
 * classes
